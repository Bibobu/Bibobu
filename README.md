Hi, Iâ€™m @Bibobu
I have a training in physics and specially computational physics.
Hence this github profile. I am specialised in using molecular modeling
softwares, coded a few things for LAMMPS but I like to experiment and code
new stuff in new programming langages (I often code in Python, a bit of C/C++,
used to do Fortran, trying to learn Rust). I am a Linux and (neo)vim user on a
daily basis and am now associate professor at the IUT Grand Ouest Normandie, in France.

You can reach me on my [pro](germain.clavier@unicaen.fr) or [perso](germain.clavier@gmail.com) mail adresses...
or give a sight to the barely living [blog](www.enthalpiste.com) (mostly in french) I have.

Lang: ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±(een beetje), ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸(un poco)
